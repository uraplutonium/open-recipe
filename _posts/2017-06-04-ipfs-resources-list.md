The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities.
IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications.
It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
IPFS enables completely decentralized and distributed apps.
And it now supports fully dynamic apps, like real-time chat!
